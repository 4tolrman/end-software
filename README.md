How often are you sick? Silly question, sure, but not one that doesn't create implications. Could you afford to pay hundreds of dollars for someone to merely diagnose you with an illness?

Unfortunately there are many that cannot.

And also unfortunately there are many websites that claim that if you give them your symptoms they will give you the illness, hazards, potential causes, and treatments for your illness. 

And....
None of them work.

With the income of Watson by IBM, this technology is incoming. But it may be several months or years.
